Good afternoon, everyone,

Today, we gather to celebrate the life of Janu Lingeswaran, a beloved friend, son, brother, and a beacon of light in our community. Janu's untimely departure has left us all reeling with shock and profound sadness, yet we are here not only to mourn his loss but also to celebrate the remarkable person he was and the legacy he leaves behind.

Janu was more than just a digital content creator; he was a visionary, a dreamer, and a compassionate soul who touched the lives of many through his work and his unwavering commitment to making a difference. With his infectious energy, boundless creativity, and unwavering determination, Janu inspired countless individuals, including myself, to dream bigger and reach higher.

One of Janu's greatest passions was his dedication to helping others, particularly those struggling with ADHD. He recognized the challenges and stigmas associated with ADHD and embarked on a mission to create a platform where ADHD students could find support, resources, and a sense of belonging. Janu's vision was not just about building a website; it was about building a community, a safe space where individuals could embrace their differences and thrive.

Janu poured his heart and soul into this project, tirelessly advocating for awareness, understanding, and acceptance of ADHD. He believed that every individual, regardless of their challenges, deserved to be seen, heard, and valued. Through his platform, Janu aimed to empower ADHD students to embrace their unique strengths, pursue their passions, and pursue their dreams without fear or limitation.

Beyond his professional endeavors, Janu was a friend like no other. His infectious laughter, warm smile, and genuine kindness brought joy to all who knew him. He had an uncanny ability to lift spirits, spark laughter, and make even the darkest days a little brighter. Janu's presence illuminated every room he entered, leaving an indelible mark on the hearts of all who had the privilege of knowing him.

As we mourn Janu's passing, let us also celebrate the beautiful legacy he leaves behind. Let us honor his memory by continuing his mission of spreading love, kindness, and compassion in a world that often feels dark and uncertain. Let us carry forward his vision of inclusivity, empathy, and understanding, and strive to make the world a better place in his honor.

Janu may no longer be with us in body, but his spirit, his passion, and his unwavering belief in the power of humanity will live on forever in the hearts of those he touched. As we bid farewell to our dear friend, let us take comfort in knowing that his legacy will continue to inspire and uplift us for generations to come.

Rest in peace, dear Janu. Your light will shine on eternally in our hearts.
